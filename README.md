# Multi Agent Research system

## Summary
This is a proof of concept for a multi agent research system using llangchain and local LLMs with ollama. Mainly aimed at physics.
## Architechture

It currently consists of 2 agents, a researcher and a coder. The researcher searches the web for papers on the given topic the users prompts about and the coder generates code to verify some physical measures about the system.

## To Do

Improve the agents architechture adding

- Prompt enhancer
- Code reviewer
- Physics reviewer
